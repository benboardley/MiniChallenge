# MiniChallenge

This is my Implementation for the ECE 50024 Mini Challenge.

I utilized the ConvNeXt model small, I cropped the images first and then transformed the images to tensors in order to help improve the efficiency of my dataloaders, after this I trained the model using MiniChallengeLarge and I generated the submission csv with Generate Test Results. 

This resulted in an 81% accuracy on the test results.
